Generate dictatorial propapaganda speeches about any chosen topic.

Written with React, Vite and Netlify Functions.


# Prerequisites

Install Node (tested with v18.16.0) and [Netlify CLI](https://docs.netlify.com/cli/local-development/)

Then install dependencies.

```sh
npm install
```

# Launching

```sh
npm run dev
```

This will launch the Vite development server (for the React client) and the Netlify dev server simultaneously.
